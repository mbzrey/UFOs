# UFO Sighting Database Webpage

## Overview of Project

The UFO Sightings webpage allows the user to search within a small database of UFO sightings, filtering by date.
However, it would be best if users could filter the database through other variables, such as City, State, Country or Shape of the sighting.
This project addresses this situation, allowing users to refine their search.

## Results

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
There is a description of how to perform a search, with images.
The new webpage includes a new filtering tool, which lets user refine their search/filtering.
The process is simple: users need only to type the search/filter criteria inside the appropriate box and type 'Enter' on the keyboard.

For example, let's start from the very beginning. This is how the webpage looks before applying any filters:

The user might be looking for UFO sightings of a 'triangle' shape. The webpage updates the results after the typing the 'Enter' key.

What if the user refines search/filter by typing "el cajon" in the City box? The webpage updates, including the previous search/filter criteria "triangle" shape:

If the user tries to analyze all of the UFO sightings in "el cajon", it is only needed to delete the search/filter "triangle" in the shape box (update will be executed upon typing the 'Enter' key):

## Summary

The goal f the project has been achieved, as the search/filter tool works properly.

However, its use requires the use of a keyboard and type the 'Enter' key at any change in the search/filter words. This is not intuitive and user may not be able to use the tool as expected.

In order to offer more user friendly tool, it would be advisable to:
* Add a button to perform the search/filtering of the database.
* Add a drop-down list in the search/filter tool, so that users may look for the possible inputs, instead of writing the desired values on a box.
